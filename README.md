# *uMaC*
uMaC is a new computational method that unifies two orthogonal pieces of information, i.e. methylation and CNAs, derived from whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data to estimate enriched ctDNA fragments' tumor fraction and CNA status from cell-free DNA (cfDNA).

## Description
uMaC is a two-component framework, in which the first component models methylation changes, and the second one models CNAs, sequentially. Briefly, the methylation-component implements a Bayesian model to enrich ctDNA fragments from cfDNA data, based on distinct haplotypic hypo-methylation patterns in tumor vs. normal cfDNA; the CNA-component implements a hidden Markov model (HMM) to detect CNAs based on sequencing depth profiles in data with enriched ctDNA fragments.

The Bayes model and HMM model are described in: A computational framework to unify orthogonal information in DNA methylation and copy number aberrations in cell-free DNA for cancer detection.
